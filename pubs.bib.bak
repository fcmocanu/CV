  Abstract                 = {The radiation hardness of amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 phase-change random-access memory material has been elucidated by ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations. Ionizing radiation events have been modeled to investigate their effect on the atomic and electronic structure of the glass. Investigation of the short- and medium-range order highlights a structural recovery of the amorphous network after exposure to the high-energy events modeled in this study. Analysis of the modeled glasses reveals specific structural rearrangements in the local atomic geometry of the glass, as well as an increase in the formation of large shortest-path rings. The electronic structure of the modeled system is not significantly affected by the ionizing radiation events, since negligible differences have been observed before and after irradiation. These results provide a detailed insight into the atomistic structure of amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 after irradiation and demonstrate the radiation hardness of the glass matrix.},

  Abstract                 = {Amorphous and crystalline materials differ in their long-range structural order. On the other hand, short-range order in amorphous and crystalline materials often appears similar. Here, we use a recently introduced method for obtaining quantitative measures for structural similarity to compare crystalline and amorphous materials. We compare seven common crystalline polymorphs of TiO2, all assembled out of TiO6 or TiO7 polyhedral building blocks, to liquid and amorphous TiO2 in a quantitative two-dimensional similarity plot. We find high structural similarity between a model of amorphous TiO2, obtained by ab initio molecular-dynamics, and the B-TiO2 crystalline polymorph. The general approach presented here sheds new light on a long-standing controversy in the structural theory of amorphous solids.},
